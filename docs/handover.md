# Handover of `Rdf Graph`
This will be a smaller handover as we hope this library don't need much maintenance. This is mainly to cover all dependency of splinter, and rdf-graph is a dependency of splinter admin. However, after this PR is merged rdf-graph will officially be handed over to Spine Semantic Infrastructure, so we should spend some time with this repository.

- [ ] Overall introduction of `Rdf Graph` has been given to `SSI`
- [ ] Admin Role of Github repo transferred to `SSI`
  - [ ] 1. `SSI` team promoted or added as Admin
  - [ ] 2. Dugtrio demoted / removed from team access list
- [ ] Transfer ownership of CI/CD pipelines to `[receiving_team]`
